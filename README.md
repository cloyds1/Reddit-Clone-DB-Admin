# Reddit-Clone-DB-Admin

Notes from Sean Cloyd:

This is a rough draft of the Database powered Reddit Clone project. 

redditclonedb.sql contains all the sql statements required to construct the database, with a couple of test entries I used. 

I'm still working on the utilities for handling replies.

Admin/Manager/User roles haven't been fully implemented yet, but the utilities are almost done.
